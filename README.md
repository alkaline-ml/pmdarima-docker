# pmdarima docker

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/alkaline-ml/pmdarima-docker.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/alkaline-ml/pmdarima-docker)

The images built here are used for one of two purposes:

  1. As base images for testing and doc generation for the
     [`pmdarima`](http://github.com/tgsmith61591/pmdarima) project. Note that
     for this purpose, the only images that should be included are those that
     help significantly reduce CI/CD build times (i.e., PyPy base, which is
     currently pinned to Python 3.6).
    
  2. To serve as pre-built base images with `pmdarima` already installed.
     Images that serve this purpose will be tagged with the version of
     `pmdarima` that they have installed.
       
### Pulling images

All images are pushed to the `alkalineml` prefix. You can pull whatever image you like
with `docker pull`, e.g.:

```bash
$ docker pull alkalineml/pmdarima-circle-pypy-base:latest
$ docker pull alkalineml/pmdarima:latest
```

Running the containers will start an `ipython` session by default:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it alkalineml/pmdarima:local
Python 3.7.4 (default, Sep 12 2019, 15:40:15)
